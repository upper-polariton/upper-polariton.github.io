<h1> Current Job Offers (2) </h1>

<h2>1. Postdoctoral position in Polaritonic Chemistry project </h2>

When photoactive molecules interact strongly with confined light modes as found in plasmonic structures or optical cavities, new hybrid light-matter states can form, the so-called polaritons. These polaritons are coherent super-positions of excitations of the molecules and of the cavity photon or surface plasmon. Recent experimental and theoretical works suggest that access to these polaritons in cavities might provide a totally new and attractive paradigm for controlling chemical reactions.

<p>

In the project we are closely working together with the <a HREF="https://www.jyu.fi/science/en/physics/research/materials-physics/molecular-electronics-and-plasmonics">Molecular electronics and plasmonics</a> group of Prof. Jussi Toppari and the <a HREF="https://www.jyu.fi/science/en/physics/research/materials-physics/condensed-matter-theory">condensed matter theory group</a> of Prof. Tero Heikkila to understand the effects of strong coupling on molecules with the aim of ultimately design nanophotonic devices for manipulating chemical reactivity. 

For our team we are searching motivated and talented individuals who want to either work on a  theoretical model to predict the effect of strong coupling, or on experiments to validate that model. 


<h2>2. Postdoctoral position in ProtoMot project</h2>

The objective of ProtoMot is to 
elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the proton-motive force rectifies 
the Brownian motion of the c-subunit ring of ATPase into unidirectional 
rotation.

<p>
As a Postdoctoral researcher 
 you will:<p> 
<ul>
<li>create atomistic, coarse-grained and multi-scale simulation models for various ATPases, using experimental data from both x-ray and electron microscopy in collaboration with <a href="http://www.schroderlab.org/">Gunnar Schroeder</a> at the Forschungszentrum Juelich and <a href="www.rug.nl/research/molecular-dynamics/">Siewert-Jan Marrink</a> at the University of Groningen.
<li> quantify the efficiency of Brownian motors in generating torque from
simulations
<li>identify proton transfer pathways to and from the c-ring of the Fo subunit in FoF1 ATPases
<li>exploit the insights from simulations on ATPases as well as ATPase model systems to design and test artificial proton-fueled rotary motors that operate according to the principles of the ATPases.
</ul>

<p>

To apply, please email your motivation letter, curriculum vitae, including a  publication
