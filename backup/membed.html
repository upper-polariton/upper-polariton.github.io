<h2>Introduction</h2>
We have developed a <a href="http://www.gromacs.org/">Gromacs</a>  tool, g_membed, to 
efficiently insert a protein into a fully hydrated and equilibrated membrane. 
Therefore, the protein is reduced in size in the membrane plane, overlapping 
molecules (lipids, waters, etc.) are removed and finally a short molecular dynamics run (typically 1,000 steps) is performed to grow the protein slowly to its full size.<br>

Also in highly curved bilayers, proteins can be inserted efficiently, as illustrated by the vesicle system.

<h2>Additional data</h2>
<a href="http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~ggroenh/membed/sample.mdp">sample.mdp</a> is an example of a mdp file needed to generate an input tpr-file. <br>
<p>
We tried g_membed on several test systems. You can download the 
<a href="http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~ggroenh/membed/Beta-barrel_popc_water.pdb">pdb</a> and 
<a href="http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~ggroenh/membed/Beta-barrel_popc_water.top">topology file</a> of
a Beta-barrel overlapping a popc membrane and spc water system, to try it yourself. <br>
<p>
A short manual is given in the help option of g_membed itself. For a more extensive manual see the appendix of our <a href="submitted">paper</a>.<br>
