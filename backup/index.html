<h1>Welcome</h1>

Our aim is to understand and ultimately
tailor the chemical properties of biomolecular systems. To achieve our goals we develop new strategies to combine advanced molecular dynamics techniques with high-level
quantum chemistry approaches.
Our
developments are made available to other researchers in the molecular
dynamics program package <a HREF=http://www.gromacs.org>Gromacs</a>.
<p>
Currently, there are vacancies for postdocs, phd students and master's students. If you would like to join us, let us know!

<h1>Motivation</h1>

Interaction between biology, physics, and chemistry is presently
providing a window into the exciting new era of
biotechnology. Enzymes, in particular, that can catalyze chemical
reactions with a high efficiency and under very mild conditions,
provide valuable templates for artificial devices that we will need to
meet the challenges of the 21st century. Mimicking biochemical
processes however, requires complete understanding of the underlying
molecular dynamics. As the relevant time and spatial resolution are
notoriously hard to access experimentally, computer simulations are
the methods of choice to deepen our understanding of how proteins have
evolved to mediate chemical reactions and to use these insight to
create devices that mimic biological function.<p>

<h1>Research</h1>

Here is an overview of the projects that we are working on. As we always try to think of new projects, and finish old ones, 
this list will never be
completely up-to-date. The group is always looking for motivated
people to join our efforts. Thus, if you are interested in one of the
projects, or would like to see one of your projects added to the list,
let us know!
<p>

<li><b>Computational Photochemistry</b>

<p>
Organisms have evolved a wide variety of mechanisms to utilize and
respond to light. In many cases, the biological response is mediated
by structural changes that follow photon absorption. These reactions
typically occur at femto- to picosecond timescales, and are thus within reach of QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations.
<p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td class="<caption"><font face="arial"><small>AsFP, a switchable fluorescen
t protein..</small></font></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In our simulations, we use a multi-configurational quantum mechanical
(QM) description (CASSCF, CASPT2) to model the electronic
rearrangement for those parts of the system that are involved in the
absorption.  For the remainder, typically consisting of the apoprotein
and the solvent, a simple forcefield model (MM) suffices.QM/MM
gradients are computed on-the-fly, and a diabatic surface hopping
procedure is used to model the excited state decay. We have
demonstrated the validity of this hybrid QM/MM approach for
photobiological reactions in recent applications on photoactivation of
photoreceptor proteins, on photo-switching of fluorescent proteins and
on benign and malign photochemical reactions in
DNA.  In addition to providing quantities that are
experimentally accessible, such as structural intermediates,
fluorescence lifetimes, quantum yields and spectra, the simulations
provide also information that is much more difficult to measure
experimentally, such as reaction mechanisms and the influence of
individual aminoacid residues.

In a new project, funded by the
<a HREF=http://www.volkswagen-stiftung.de/>Volkswagen Foundation</a>,
we aim to go one step further and use computer simulation to design
mutants with desired photochemical properties. This way we hope to
contribute to new developments in for instance bio-imaging, and
information technology.

<p>
<li><b>Electron and Proton Transfer</b>
<p>
Electron transfer lies at the heart of biology. Despite the
availability of high-resolution x-ray structures of many of the
protein complexes involved in photosynthesis and metabolism, the
mechanistic details of how electron transfer occurs at a molecular
level are still unclear. Our current understanding of electron
transfer reactions is based on empirical models, such as Marcus
theory, which only provide a qualitative non-atomistic picture and
cannot be used to design new systems. To find out in atomistic detail
how proteins have evolved to meditate electron transfer processes and
how they reach the observed high efficiencies a more general
formulation of electron transfer is required.
<br>
<table class="image"><tr><td><img  src="rc.png" align="center"
width="500">
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="<caption"><font face="arial"><small>Photosynthetic reaction cente
r embedded in a lipid bilayer.</small></font></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Electron transfer is driven by geometrical distortions that change the
molecular orbitals. In biological systems these distortions are often
imposed by the protein environment. In addition, the response of the
environment upon changes in oxidation state of the prostetic groups
can have a strong dynamic effect as well.

<li><b>Radiation Damage</b>
<p>
Exposure to high doses of high-energy radiation causes irreversible damage in biological matter. At lower doses alteration of the genetic information is possible, leading to mutations. Despite the relevance of these processes in biology, little is known about the mechanism by which irradiation can cause destruction or mutation.
<p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td class="<caption"><font face="arial"><small>DNA with a thymine dimer that
 was formed after absorption of UV light.</small></font></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Using the multi-reference (CASSCF) electronic structure method to
compute the forces acting on the nuclei at each step of the molecular
dynamics simulation, the response of the system to the irradiation can
be studied in atomic detail. 
Although we thus far addressed only
photochemical reactions initiated by optical transitions in
biomolecules, there are no restrictions on using our approach to
simulate also the effect of other radiation types on biomolecules,
including DNA and cell membranes.

<li><b>Molecular Dynamics at constant pH</b>
<p>
In standard molecular dynamics simulations protons are assigned to titrating sites at the start of the simulation and not allowed to change. However, in proteins the protonation is intimately linked to conformation. Conformational changes can induce changes in protonation state, and vice versa. To take this correlations into account, we have developed a technique that treats protons as additional dynamic variables. Protons can be created and annihilated on-the-fly, depending on interactions with the local environment the and the pH. The latter is a parameter that users of the gromacs MD program can set. With this approach, we have a means to study the effect of pH on biomolecular processes, including catalysis (see below). Also, we have now a means to 'equilibrate' protons in x-ray structures, that do not show their positions.


<li><b>Enzyme Dynamics</b>
<p>
The QM/MM method has become an established tool in computational
enzymatics. However, in most QM/MM studies, only the electrostatic
effect of the protein environment is considered. Dynamic contributions
are often overlooked. Protein motions can correlate strongly with the
reaction dynamics, suggesting why mutations far from the active site
can affect the catalysis. 
<p>
<table class="image">
<tr><td><img  src="active-site.png" align="center"
width="500">
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="<caption"><font face="arial"><small>Active site of Triosephosphate Isomeraze.</small></font></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Computing dynamic trajectories at room
temperature (300 K) is therefore more realistic than calculating the
minimum energy pathway (0 K), in which important entropic effects are
ignored. However, most enzymatic reactions are relatively slow
processes, ranging from microseconds to seconds, and are thus out of
reach for even the most efficient QM/MM sampling schemes available
today. In contrast, with the right choice of simulation protocol the
lower range of these time scales can be achieved in classical MD
simulations. Therefore, to explore the effect of the enzyme dynamics
on catalytic processes we combine long-term classical sampling
with occasional short QM/MM simulations.
