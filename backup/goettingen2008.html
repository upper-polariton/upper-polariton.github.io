<h2>Background</h2> We are happy to announce the second special
Gromacs workshop together with Helmut Grubmueller &amp; Bert de Groot
at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Goettingen,
Germany. As in the previous workshop at Stanford Universiy, the scope
of this workshop is to gather people working on new or otherwise
advanced simulations algorithms, either in- or outside Gromacs, but
that we believe could be interesting to support in the future. In
contrast to the previous tutorials given e.g. in Helsinki, we will
assume that the participants here are fairly comfortable with Gromacs,
or at least MD simulations in general. We are planning three full days
with a mix of formal talks, birds-of-a-feather sessions, hands-on
tutorials and question-and-answer sessions in smaller groups. The main
Gromacs developers plan to be present.

<h2>Topics covered</h2>

There are a couple of interesting topics that we have already
selected:
<ul>
<li>The new domain decomposition parallelization in Gromacs 4.0, with
    some tips &amp; tricks to get the most out of your hardware.</li>
<li>MD of very large systems</li>
<li>Non-Equilibrium MD/Force probe simulations</li>
<li>Validation of simulation by experiment and <i>vice versa</i></li>
<li>QM/MM. How do you mix Quantum Mechanics with Gromacs?</li>
<li>Virtual sites for hydrogen motion removal and long time-steps</li>
<li>Membrane protein simulations</li>
<li>Replica exchange</li>
<li>Gromacs source code walk-through</li>
</ul>
<p>
However, these are just examples. We would be particularly interested
in participants who would like to contribute a small talk (anywhere
from 15 to 30 mins) on their favorite subject, or if you have special
requests about topics you'd like to learn more about.
</p>

<h2>Location</h2> The workshop will be given in Max Planck Institute
for Biophysical Chemistry, Am Fassberg 11, D-37077 Goettingen,
Germany. For more information and directions, have a look at
<a href="http://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/english/institut/anfahrt/index.html">http://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/english/institut/anfahrt/index.html</a>
.
<br>
We start in the large seminar room in the administration building on
Wednesday September 24 at 9:00 am, and finish on Friday Septeber 26
at 5:00pm.

<h2>Travel &amp; accomodation</h2> The easiest way to reach Goettinen
is to fly to Hannover
(<a href="http://www.hannover-airport.de/">HAJ</a>) or Frankfurt
(<a href="http://www.airportcity-frankfurt.com/">FRA</a>). From both
airports there is a good railway connection with the Deutsche Bahn
(<a href="http://www.db.de/">DB</a>) to Goettingen. From the main
station, you can either take
the <a href="http://www.goevb.de/CMS/">bus</a> (line 5) or taxi (10
euro's) to reach the institute or the hotel.
<br><br> We have reserved a number of rooms in
hotel <a href="http://www.hotel-beckmann.de/">Beckmann</a> for the
duration of the workshop. The hotel is a 15 minutes walk from the
institute. There is a bus connection to downtown Goettingen every 30
minutes. You will have to make a reservation yourself, but use the
group code "Gromacs Workshop" to get a lower rate.
<br><br> The hotel rooms are <small>EUR</small> 44.00 per night for
singles, and <small>EUR</small> 74.00 per night for doubles.  Please
share rooms if you can/want, since we could only reserve a limited
number of rooms.

<H2>Cost?</h2>  It's free!  However, you will have to take care of
your own travel, accomodation and food.

<h2>Other questions</h2> Please contact Gerrit Groenhof
on <a href="mailto:ggroenh@gwdg.de">ggroenh@gwdg.de</a>, or ask on the
gmx-users mailing list.

<h2>Registration Info</h2> Typically we would simply say "first come,
first served", but we will give priority to participants who are
willing to give brief presentations (remember, we want this to be
two-way communication!) as long as they register the first two days.
<br>
Thus, start by filling in the form below, and wait for a confirmation
email. Note that we the first round of confirmations won't be sent
until 1st of June, so we can do random selection based on the
priorities above, just in case there is a gold-rush of early birds.
<br> After that it will be first-come, first-served.
<br><br>

While registration isn't binding, we ask you to only register if you
will take part in the entire workshop (you are welcome to drop by
anyway :-), and <i>please</i> let us know as soon as possible if you
change your mind and decide not to come, so somebody else can use your
slot!
<br>

<h2>Registration Form</h2>

Registration is closed.

<br>
Once again, very welcome to the workshop, and hope to see you in Goettingen in September!
