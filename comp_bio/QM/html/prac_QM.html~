<h1>Introduction</h1>

In the previous lecture we've learned about the theoretical basis of electronic 
structure methods, and in  particular about the Hartree-Fock method.
Now it is time to jump into the electronic structure business and perform
a couple of calculations by yourself.

The package we are going to use is called <a href="http://www.molpro.net">MOLPRO</a>, which has been developed 
by Peter Knowles and Hans-Juergen Werner over the last 15 years. It is among
the modern electronic structure codes available and provides an easy-to-use scripting language that allows for
a user-friendly access to quantum chemistry. Additionaly <a href="http://www.molpro.net">MOLPRO</a> provides for the largest set of implemented post-Hartree-Fock methods.

<br> <p>
To learn how to use the program by yourself or maybe extend your knowledge beyond the 
scope of this tutorial one can check out the
links "Quick Start" or "User's Manual" on the <a href="http://www.molpro.net/info/users?portal=user">following site</a>
<br> <p>
To start a calculation we basically need four things:

<UL>
<LI> the structure of the molecule of interest in (cartesian) coordinates
<LI> the overall charge of our system
<LI> the method that will be used (Hartree-Fock (HF),
Density Functional Theory (DFT), Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory (MPx) etc.)
<LI> a basis set.

</UL>

The files needed for this practical can be downloaded as an archive <a href="../downloads/prakt1_tar.gz" title="prakt1_tar">here</a>
and unpacked by typing<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
tar xzvf prakt1.tar.gz
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>

<h3>The H-H molecule</h3>

Our first calculation will be the simple H2 molecule, which is the smallest
molecule that exhibits all fundamental aspects of chemical bonding (why?).<br>
A simple input for the electronic structure calculation of H2 is given below:
<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
basis=6-31G
r=1.0 ang
geometry={angstrom;
          h1;
          h2,h1,r}
hf
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>
First, the basis (6-31G) using the so-called Pople notation is specified. G stands for "Gaussian", so a GTO basis with 6 gaussian functions for the inner (non-valence) electrons and 4 (3+1) for 
the valence electrons is used. Then, the H-H distance and the so-called internal coordinates (bonds,angles, torsions) are specified.Finally, the key word "hf" stands for "do a Hartree-Fock calculation" 
<br> <p>
Now we start out first electronic structure calculation by typing

<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
molpro h2.com 
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>

During the calculation MOLRPO writes an output file that communicates the most 
important infos to the user. Please extract the following information: 
<UL>
<LI> number of SCF cycles needed for convergence
<LI> the HF energy (what units are being used?)
<LI> the dipole moment

</UL>

Additionaly you could extract the individual HF energies after each SCF cycle and plot them 
against the number of cycles.<br> <p>

In the next step we want to perform the visualization of the bonding and antibonding molecular
orbitals (MO) of the H2 molecule. For this we have to redo are electronic structure calculation:
<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
molpro h2_orbitals.com 
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>

The same calculation as in the previous step will be performed, but additionaly the MOs 
and the electron density are written to external files. To view the MOs, we will have to use <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</a>, a molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems using 3-D graphics and built-in scripting.

Typing
<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
vmd -e orbitals.vmd
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>
will load an existing script that loads the relevant MOs.
In the VMD main window you can activate(deactivate) the two MO and the electron density while clicking on the D entry for each MO/density entry in the main window. Which orbital is the bonding, which one is the anti-bonding one?<br> <p>

So far, we have only performed so-called single-point calculations, i.e. computed the HF energy
for a fixed nuclear configuration. MOLPRO is quite versatile when it comes to automatically 
perform scans along selected coordinates. In our case of the H2, we will now 
determine the energy profile (or the potential energy surface (PES)) along the H-H distance. The input 
file now looks like this:

<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
r=[0.3 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 2.0 4.0 6.0] ang

basis=6-31G

i=1
geometry={
          h1;
          h2,h1,r(i)}


do i=1,#r   !loop over range of bond distances
 hf                
 e1(i)=energy
enddo

{table,r,e1
  title,HF PES for H-H
  plot,file='h2_hf_pes.plot'
}
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>


the program will loop over all specified distances and perform for each of those an independent SCF calculation. Finally, a table of the respective HF energies will be written to a file called <em>h2_hf_pes.plot</em><br> <p>

Now we going to use the plot program "xmgrace" that comes with most Linux distributions
to look at the PES. Typing 

<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
xmgrace h2_hf_pes.plot 
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>
will reveal the electronic HF energy as a function of the H-H distance.
What is the energy one would expect for the dissociation limit (i.e. r-> oo) of H-H? <br> <p>

As pointed out in the lecture, the HF method gives molecular interaction energies that are only 
approximations to the exact quantum many-body energy. In the following we will study the effect 
of improving the HF approximation. This will be achieved via perturbation theory, the so-called 
Moeller-Plesset (MPx, where x gives the order in the perturbation expansion) and variational 
multi-determinant methods, like e.g. configuration interaction (CI). In molpro this can simply be 
achieved by adding the respective keywords:

<br> <p>
<div class="code">

<pre>
r=[0.3 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0] ang

basis=6-31G

i=1
geometry={
          h1;
          h2,h1,r(i)}

do i=1,#r   !loop over range of bond distances
 hf          ;e_hf(i)=energy
 mp2,NOCHECK ;e_mp2(i)=energy
 casscf      ;e_cas(i)=energy
 mrci        ;e_ci(i)=energy
enddo

{table,r,e_hf,e_mp2,e_cas,e_ci
  title,HF PES for H-H
  plot,file='h2_methods_pes.plot'
}
</pre>
</div>
<br>
<IMG align="right" SRC="../images/h2o.jpg" alt="h2o" width="298" height="283">
<p>
After a sucessful finish of the MOLPRO run you can have a look at the four PESs again using "xmgrace".
In our example the CI method (mrci) can be considered as the most accurate. CASSCF stands for "complete active space SCF", which can be regarded as a truncated CI expansion. Compare your result with respect to the obtained equilibrium bonding distance (How large is the error for this quantity?) and the dissociation limit for 
each method. Hereby the CI results should serve as the reference energy curve. Repeat the calculation with changing the 
order in the perturbation expansion from 2 to 4 (mp2 -> mp4) and compare the two results. What is the error in the CI result 
compared to the analytical results of -1 Hartree. How can we improve the CI dissociation energy?<br> <p><p>

<h3>The water molecule</h3>

Now we going to move to a slightly more complex molecule having three nuclei and 10 electrons: the water monomer. For the structural information <a href="http://www.molpro.net">MOLPRO</a> allows for the use of 
the convient xyz in cartesian coordinates format. An example xyz-File is shown here:

<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
    3
remark line
    O    0.00000   0.00000   0.00000 
    H    0.00000   0.00000   0.94000 
    H    0.00000   0.99030  -0.23192 
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>
With this structure, which does not represent the well-known equilibrium structure of water, we first have to perform a so-called geometry optimization. During the geometry optimization cycle a SCF calculation is performed. This one is used to compute the gradient of the total energy on the nuclei, which is then used
to perform a move of the nuclei. Then the new nuclei positions are feeded into a new SCF calculation. These
steps are repeated until the structure (=positions of the nuclei) does not change anymore.
<br> <p>
The input file for a geometry optimization looks like this:
<br> <p>
<div class="code">

<pre>
basis=6-31G                  !basis set

geomtyp=xyz
GEOMETRY=h2o.xyz

hf                           !Hartree-Fock

optg,savexyz=h2o_opt.xyz
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>

Compare the optimized geometry "h2o_opt.xyz" with your input geometry "h2o.xyz" using VMD. Determine the bond distances and the bending angle in the water molecule. How does it compare to the experimental results? How can we further improve the structure? How many geometry optimization cycles were necessary to converge the geometry? (you could also plot the number of cycles against the corresponding HF energy using "xmgrace" or "gnuplot")

Using the optimized geometry, we are now computing the MOs of water. 
Have a look at the input file "h2o_orbitals.com" first and try to analyze what is going on 
in this type of calculation. Then type
<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
molpro h2o_orbitals.com 
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>


The generated MOs can again be visualized using VMD:
<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
vmd -e orbitals.vmd
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>
Have a look at all occupied MOs and elucidate their role for bonding in the water monomer.
Which atomic orbitals of the individual atoms are predominately participating in each MO?
Compare the MOs with the ones shown on the following web site:
<a href="http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/h2oorb.html">Molecular Orbitals of the Water Monomer</a>
<br> <p>


<h3>Caffeine</h3>
<IMG align="left" SRC="../images/caffeine.png" alt="caffeine" width="150" height="118">
Finally we are gonna to compute the electronic structure of the well-known 
Caffeine molecule, which is a xanthine alkaloid compound that acts as a stimulant in humans.
The structure of this biomolecule is shown to the left.<br> <p><br><p><br><p><br><p>

Type to start the HF caclulation:
<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
molpro caffeine.com &
tail -f caffeine.out
</pre>

</div>
<br> <p>
and observe the information that is written to the screen.
How long does one SCF cycle take on average? How many electrons are involved during this computation?
The so-called HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) can be visualized using VMD:
<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
vmd -e orbitals.vmd
</pre>
</div>
<br> <p>
How many occpuied MO are there?
If there is some time left, try to compute all orbitals by changing "HOMO" to "ALL" in the input file.
Then visualize them along the same lines as in the previous example.
<br> <p>
