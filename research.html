<h1>Computational Photochemistry</h1>
<p>
Organisms have evolved a wide variety of mechanisms to utilize and
respond to light. In many cases, the biological response is mediated
by structural changes that follow photon absorption. These reactions
typically occur at femto- to picosecond timescales, and are thus within reach of QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations.

<p>
In our simulations, we use a multi-configurational quantum mechanical
(QM) description (CASSCF, CASPT2) to model the electronic
rearrangement for those parts of the system that are involved in the
absorption.  For the remainder, typically consisting of the apoprotein
and the solvent, a simple forcefield model (MM) suffices.QM/MM
gradients are computed on-the-fly, and a diabatic surface hopping
procedure is used to model the excited state decay. We have
demonstrated the validity of this hybrid QM/MM approach for
photobiological reactions in recent applications on photoactivation of
photoreceptor proteins, on photo-switching of fluorescent proteins and
on benign and malign photochemical reactions in
DNA.  In addition to providing quantities that are
experimentally accessible, such as structural intermediates,
fluorescence lifetimes, quantum yields and spectra, the simulations
provide also information that is much more difficult to measure
experimentally, such as reaction mechanisms and the influence of
individual aminoacid residues.

<p>
With the insigths acquired from simulations, we aim to go one step further and use computer simulation to design
fluorescent proteins with desired photochemical properties. This way we hope to
contribute to new developments in for instance bio-imaging, and
information technology.

<h1>Polaritonic Chemistry</h1>
<p>
When photoactive molecules interact strongly with confined light modes as found in plasmonic structures or optical cavities, new hybrid light-matter states can form, the so-called polaritons. These polaritons are coherent superpositions (in the quantum mechanical sense) of excitations of the molecules and of the cavity photon or surface plasmon. Recent experimental and theoretical works suggest that access to these polaritons in cavities could provide a totally new and attractive paradigm for controlling chemical reactions that falls in between traditional chemical catalysis and coherent laser control. However, designing cavity parameters to control chemistry requires a theoretical model with which the effect of the light-matter coupling on the molecular dynamics can be predicted accurately. Therefore, we have developed a multiscale molecular dynamics approach to simulate the effect of strong coupling to confined light on the reactivity of large ensembles of photoactive molecules.

<h1>Electron and Proton Transfer</h1>
<p>
Electron transfer lies at the heart of biology. Despite the
availability of high-resolution x-ray structures of many of the
protein complexes involved in photosynthesis and metabolism, the
mechanistic details of how electron transfer occurs at a molecular
level are still unclear. Our current understanding of electron
transfer reactions is based on empirical models, such as Marcus
theory, which only provide a qualitative non-atomistic picture and
cannot be used to design new systems. To find out in atomistic detail
how proteins have evolved to meditate electron transfer processes and
how they reach the observed high efficiencies a more general
formulation of electron transfer is required.
</p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td class="&lt;caption"><font face="arial"><small>Photosynthetic reaction cente
r embedded in a lipid bilayer.</small></font></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Electron transfer is driven by geometrical distortions that change the
molecular orbitals. In biological systems these distortions are often
imposed by the protein environment. In addition, the response of the
environment upon changes in oxidation state of the prostetic groups
can have a strong dynamic effect as well.

<h1>Radiation Damage</h1>
<p>
Exposure to high doses of high-energy radiation causes irreversible damage in biological matter. At lower doses alteration of the genetic information is possible, leading to mutations. Despite the relevance of these processes in biology, little is known about the mechanism by which irradiation can cause destruction or mutation.

<p>
Using the multi-reference (CASSCF) electronic structure method to
compute the forces acting on the nuclei at each step of the molecular
dynamics simulation, the response of the system to the irradiation can
be studied in atomic detail. 
Although we thus far addressed only
photochemical reactions initiated by optical transitions in
biomolecules, there are no restrictions on using our approach to
simulate also the effect of other radiation types on biomolecules,
including DNA and cell membranes.

<h1>Molecular Dynamics at constant pH</h1>
<p>
In standard molecular dynamics simulations protons are assigned to titrating sites at the start of the simulation and not allowed to change. However, in proteins the protonation is intimately linked to conformation. Conformational changes can induce changes in protonation state, and vice versa. To take this correlations into account, we have developed a technique that treats protons as additional dynamic variables. Protons can be created and annihilated on-the-fly, depending on interactions with the local environment the and the pH. The latter is a parameter that users of the gromacs MD program can set. With this approach, we have a means to study the effect of pH on biomolecular processes, including catalysis (see below). Also, we have now a means to 'equilibrate' protons in x-ray structures, that do not show their positions.

<h1>Proton transfer in Molecular Dynamics simulation</h1>
Based on the same principles as the constant pH MD simulation approach, we have developed a protocol for treating proton transfer in classical MD simulations, called HYDYN. In contrast to common reactive force field approaches for proton transfer in MD, HYDYN is thermodynamically consistent and can thus be used not onlly to investigate mechanisms of proton transfer, but also free energies, for example in umbrella sampling. Detailed balance is achieved in HYDYN through a combination of Metropolis Monte Carlo and lambda dynamics.

<h1>Enzyme Dynamics</h1>
<h2>
<p>
The QM/MM method has become an established tool in computational
enzymatics. However, in most QM/MM studies, only the electrostatic
effect of the protein environment is considered. Dynamic contributions
are often overlooked. Protein motions can correlate strongly with the
reaction dynamics, suggesting why mutations far from the active site
can affect the catalysis. 
</p>

<table class="image">
<tbody><tr><td><img src="img/active-site.png" align="center" width="500">
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="&lt;caption"><font face="arial"><small>Active site of Triosephosphate Isomeraze.</small></font></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Computing dynamic trajectories at room
temperature (300 K) is therefore more realistic than calculating the
minimum energy pathway (0 K), in which important entropic effects are
ignored. However, most enzymatic reactions are relatively slow
processes, ranging from microseconds to seconds, and are thus out of
reach for even the most efficient QM/MM sampling schemes available
today. In contrast, with the right choice of simulation protocol the
lower range of these time scales can be achieved in classical MD
simulations. Therefore, to explore the effect of the enzyme dynamics
on catalytic processes we combine long-term classical sampling
with occasional short QM/MM simulations.
