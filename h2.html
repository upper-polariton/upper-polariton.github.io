<h1>Introduction</h1>


<IMG align="right" SRC="../images/h2.jpg" alt="h2" width="277" height="379">
In the previous lecture we've learned about the theoretical basis of electronic 
structure methods, and in  particular about the Hartree-Fock method.
Now it is time to jump into the electronic structure business and perform
a couple of calculations by yourself.

The package we are going to use is
called <a href="http://www.gaussian.com">Gaussian</a>. It is among the
modern electronic structure codes available and provides an
easy-to-use interface called Gaussview that allows for a user-friendly access
to quantum
chemistry. Additionaly the <a href="http://www.gaussian.com">Gaussian program</a>
provides many post-Hartree-Fock methods.

<br> <p>To learn how to use the program by yourself or maybe extend
your knowledge beyond the scope of this tutorial one can check out the
links on
the <a href="http://www.gaussian.com/g_tech/g_ur/g09help.htm">following
site</a>.
<br> <p>
To start a calculation we basically need four things:

<UL>
<LI> the structure of the molecule of interest in (cartesian or
internal) coordinates
<LI> the overall charge and spin state of the system
<LI> the method that will be used (Hartree-Fock (HF), Density
Functional Theory (DFT), Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory (MPx)
etc.)
<LI> a basis set.

</UL>

The files needed for this practical can be downloaded as an
archive <a href="./h2.tar.gz">here</a> and unpacked by typing<br> <p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
tar xzvf h2.tar.gz
</pre>
</div>

However, you don't need these, as all files required can be created
with the information below.

<h2>The H-H molecule</h2>

Our calculations will be on the simple H2 molecule, which is the smallest
molecule that exhibits all fundamental aspects of chemical bonding (why?).

<h3>Single point energy calculation </h3>

A simple input for the electronic structure calculation of H2 is given below:
<div class="code">
<pre>
%chk=h2_SP
#P RHF 6-31G 

h2 molecule

0 1
h 
h 1 r

r 1.0

</pre>
</div>
 The first line starting with %chk specifies that we want to keep the
checkpoint file. You are free to choose a file name; I used h2_SP
(standing for single Point). Orbitals are stored on this file and can
be visualized with Gaussview. The #P tells Gaussian to print all
information during the computation. Then, the method is specified, which is
Restricted Hartree Fock (RHF) and the basis (6-31G) is selected, using
the so-called Pople notation. G stands for "Gaussian", so a GTO basis
with 6 gaussian functions for the inner (non-valence) electrons and 4
(3+1) for the valence electrons is used. Then comes a whileline
followed by a title string and another whiteline. The next two
integers represent the total charge (0 in this case), and spin
multiplicity (i.e. the eigenvalue of the S*S operator, which is
(S(S+1)=1, thus Singlet). For the geometry we use a Z-matrix. In the
case of a diatomic, one needs to specify only the interatomic distance
r, which we set at 1.0 Angstrom.
<p> 
Now we can do the electronic structure calculation by typing

<div class="code">
<pre>
g09 h2.com 
</pre>
</div>

During the calculation Gaussian writes an output file that
communicates the most important infos to the user. You can extract the
following information:
<UL>
<LI> number of SCF cycles needed for convergence
<LI> the HF energy (what units are being used?)
<LI> the dipole moment

</UL>

Additionaly you could extract the individual HF energies after each
SCF cycle and plot them against the number of cycles. I assume you
know how at least one program to visualize data<br> <p>

<h3>Molecular orbitals</h3>

In the next step we want to see the bonding and antibonding molecular
orbitals (MO) of the H2 molecule. For this we have to start the
Gaussview program by typing

<div class="code">
<pre>
gview.exe 
</pre>
</div>
In the main window, select File to open the h2_SP.chk checkpoint file.
The click the molecular orbital button
<p>
<IMG SRC="gview_MO.png" >
<p>
to open the orbital interface. There, select the Visualize tab and
click Update to render the orbitals.
<p>
<IMG SRC="mo_visualize.png" >
<p>
To see the orbtials, click on the small square in the energy diagram:

<h3>Dissociation into H atoms</h3>

So far, we have only performed so-called single-point calculations,
i.e. computed the HF energy for a fixed nuclear configuration. Gaussian
is quite versatile when it comes to automatically perform scans along
selected coordinates. In our case of the H2, we will now determine the
energy profile (or the potential energy surface (PES)) along the H-H
distance. The input file now looks like this:

<div class="code">
<pre>
%chk=h2_rhf_scan
# RHF 6-31G SCAN

h2 molecule

0 1
h
h 1 r

r 0.5 S 55 0.1

</pre>
</div>

The Scan keyword specificies that we want to scan one or more
coordinates. In our case, we scan along the intermolecular distance,
starting from 0.5 angstrom up to 6.0 Angstom in 55 steps of 0.1
Angstrom each. If you think this takes too long to compute, you can
reduce the number of steps, and increase the stepsize accordingly.
The program will loop over all specified distances and perform for
each of those an independent SCF calculation. Finally, a table of the
respective HF energies will be written to the output (.log)
file. Gaussview can be used to create plots, but you're free to use a
program of choice. In Gaussview, open the .log file, select in the
main window the Results menu and choose Scan. This will bring up a new
window showing the electronic energy as a function of the H-H
distance.
<p>
Look at the curve.  What is the energy one would expect for the dissociation
limit (i.e. r-> oo) of H-H? <br> <p>

As will be discussed in the lectures, at the dissociation limit, the
restricted Hartree Fock solution contains so-called ionic
contributions, in which both electrons are localized on one of the
atoms. This leads to a too high dissociation energy (by how much?).
Clearly these contribution should decrease with increasing
intermolecular distance r.
<p>
The Unrestricted Hartree Fock method, in which the paired alpha and
beta spins are not forced to occuppy the same orbital, overcomes this
problem (but wavefuntion is not eigenfunction of the S*S
operator). Use the UHF method and repeat the dissociation calculation.
<p>
The input file should look like
<div class="code">
<pre>
%chk=h2_uhf_scan
# UHF 6-31G SCAN guess=(mix,always)

h2 molecule

0 1
h
h 1 r

r 0.5 S 55 0.1

</pre>
</div>

Please observe that a broken symmetry UHF singlet wavefunction is only
obtained using the guess=(mix,always) keyword. If this is not used, the initial
guess is chosen such that the SCF calculation converges to the RHF
wavefunction even with the UHF Ansatz.

<h3>Beyond Restricted Hartree Fock</h3>

As pointed out in the lecture, the HF method gives molecular
interaction energies that are only approximations to the exact quantum
many-body energy. In the following we will study the effect of
improving the RHF approximation. This will be achieved via
perturbation theory, the so-called Moeller-Plesset (MPx, where x gives
the order in the perturbation expansion) and variational
multi-determinant methods, like e.g. CASSCF.
<p>
We will create an input file for each of these methods and repeat the
scans.
<p>
For MP2
<div class="code">
<pre>
%chk=h2_mp2_scan
# MP2 6-31G SCAN

h2 molecule

0 1
h
h 1 r

r 0.5 S 55 0.1

</pre>
</div>

For MP4
<div class="code">
<pre>
%chk=h2_mp4_scan 
# mp4 6-31G SCAN

h2 molecule

0 1
h
h 1 r

r 0.5 S 55 0.1

</pre>
</div>

For CASSCF. Note that since we include all electron (2) and all
orbitals (4), it is essentially full CI, apart form fact that the MO
coefficients are optimized.
<div class="code">
<pre>
%chk=h2_cas_scan
# CASSCF(2,4) 6-31G SCAN

h2 molecule

0 1
h
h 1 r

r 0.5 S 55 0.1

</pre>
</div>

After completing these calculations you can compare the dissociation
curves.  In our example the CASSCF method can be considered as the
most accurate. Compare your result with respect to the obtained
equilibrium bonding distance (How large is the error for this
quantity?) and the dissociation limit for each method. Hereby the
CASSCF results should serve as the reference energy curve.

<p>Compare the results of the calculations with second and fourth
order perturbation (MP2 -> MP4)

<p> What is the error in the CI result compared to the analytical
results of -1 Hartree. How can we improve the CI dissociation
energy?<br> <p><p>
