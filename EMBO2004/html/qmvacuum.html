<h1>I. Optimization of the product, reactant and transition state
geometries in <i>vacuo</i>, using a quantum chemistry software
package</h1>
<p>
<strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>
A transition state for a chemical reaction can be found in many
ways. With some intuition, a good guess can be made of what the
transition state should look like and start the optimization from
there. Another possibily is to define a coordinate which transforms
the reactants into product and optimize the system while varying that
coordinate. The latter approach is called a Linear Transit and will be
discussed and used in the <a HREF="qmmmvacuum.html">next part</a> of
this tutorial.
<p>
Here we will do a straight-forward <a HREF=#TS>search for the
transition state</a>, using a good guess as a starting geometry. We
will also try to optimize the <a HREF=#react>reactant</a> and <a
HREF=#react>product</a> minima.

<h1>Optimizing the transition state geometry in <i>vacuo</i>, starting
with a good guess.</h1>

<p>
We will start by optimizing the transition state of the Diels-Alder
reaction in <i>vacuo</i> at the <i>semi-empirical</i> PM3 level. This
is easy since we already have the struture of the transition state
analogue. We simply take the coordinates of that analogue from the
x-ray structure (<a
HREF=http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pid=128791089897524&pdbId=1C1E>1C1E.pdb</a>)
and modify them a bit, such that we get the appropriate input
coordinates for a <a HREF=http://www.gaussian.com>Gaussian98</a>
transition-state optimization calculation. We will use the
<i>semi-empirical</i> PM3 hamiltonian throughout this tutorial,
because of its cost-efficiency. Note that in the x-ray structure the
-R group of the analogue (<a HREF=introduction.html#fig1>Figure 1</a>)
is not resolved. We ignore that group for the moment and focus on the
system with -R = -CH3.

<p>
The following steps will lead us to the transition state geometry of
the reaction in <i>vacuo</i>.
<p>
<ul>
<li Type=1> We download <a
HREF=http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pid=128791089897524&pdbId=1C1E>1C1E.pdb</a>
x-ray structure from the pdbdatabase<br><br>

<li Type=1> We use rasmol to isolate the transition state analogue (ENH)<br><br>
<ul>
<li> open 1C1E.pdb with rasmol<br>
<font color=red>localhost:~>rasmol 1C1E.pdb</font>

<blockquote>
<img SRC=../rasmol/step1.jpg ALT="" >
</blockquote>

<li>select the TS analogue<br>RasMol>restrict ENH <br><br>

<li>center the analogue <br>RasMol>center selected <br><br> 

<li>zoom in on the analogue <br>RasMol>zoom 600<br><br>
<blockquote>
 <img SRC=../rasmol/step2.jpg ALT="" >
</blockquote>
<li> save the analogue in a seperate pbd-file<br>Rasmol>save
analogue.pdb
</ul>
<p>
<li Type=1> We use MOLDEN to create an gaussian inputfile for a
transition state optimization from analogue.pdb <br><br>

<ul>
<li> open analogue.pdb with MOLDEN <br> <font color=red>localhost:~>molden -P
analogue.pdb</font> (with the -P option MOLDEN expects pdb format as input)
<blockquote>
<img SRC=../molden/step1.jpg hsize=50>
</blockquote>
<li> click the stickcolor button in the Molden Control window to
display the atoms in different colors
<blockquote>
<img SRC=../molden/step1b_small.jpg  ALT="">
<img SRC=../molden/toolbox.jpg  ALT="">
</blockquote>
<li> click on the Zmat editor button to enter the Z-matrix
editor
<blockquote>
<img SRC=../molden/zmatrixbox1.jpg ALT=""> 
</blockquote>
<li> click on the "select by cursor" button in the Zmat editor and
select all atoms in the molecule visualiztion window by draging a box
around them with the mouse pointer. Click the "apply selection" button
to complete the selection. A Z-matrix represents the geometry in terms
of distances, angles and torsions. For instance, atom 7, is a Nitrogen
atom. The distance of this atom to atom 6 is A; the angle between this
atom and atoms 6 and 3 is 110 degrees and the torsion angle between
this atoms and atoms 6, 3 and 4 is 0.757 degrees.
<blockquote>
<img SRC=../molden/zmatrixbox2.jpg <br><br>
</blockquote>
<li> increase a bit the lengths of the two bonds that are supposed to
be formed in the Diels-Alder reaction (C4-C5 and C2-C3).  Change the
values of the bondlengths of C5-C4 and C3-C2 to, say 2 angstrom in the
Z-matrix. Now the molecule resembes the actual Transition State a bit
better already.  
<blockquote>
<img SRC=../molden/step2_small.jpg ALT=""> 
<img SRC=../molden/zmatrix_step2_small.jpg ALT="">
</blockquote>
<li> next, change the atoms of the analogue to the atoms of the actual
Transition State. Simple click on the atomname entries in the Z-matrix
editor and change them to the appropriate atoms. Click on the "apply
changes to current Z-mat" button for the changes to take
effect.
<blockquote>
<img SRC=../molden/step2b_small.jpg  ALT="">
<img SRC=../molden/zmatrix_step2b_small.jpg ALT="">
</blockquote>
<li> saturate the complex with hydrogens. Use the "add line" button to
chose a hydrogen atoms and add them to the molecule by clicking on the
unsaturated atoms first followed by clicking two more atoms to define
an angle and a torsion respectively. The result should look like
this:
<blockquote>
<img SRC=../molden/step4.jpg ALT="">
</blockquote>
<li> save the Z-matrix into a gaussian format. Clicking the "Gaussian"
buttom at the bottom of the editor, type a name (<i>e.g.</i> TS.com)
in the "File name ?" window and click the "write Z-matrix"
button.
<blockquote>
<img SRC=../molden/zmatrix_step4.jpg ALT="">
</blockquote>
<li> quit molden by clicking the skull icon in the Molden Control
window
</ul>
<p>

<li Type=1> The next step is to make an input file for Gaussian. We
use an ordinary text editor, such as emacs to complete the input file.
<p>
<ul>
<li> open TS.com with emacs<br><font color=red>localhost:~>rasmol 1C1E.pdb</font><br><br>


<li> add the gaussian keywords for a transition state optimization (#P
PM3 OPT=(TS,noeigentest) TEST) and compete the input file. We use a
so-called checkpoint file (%chk=TS, first line) to store all optimized
parameters. after the modification we save it as TS.com. An example of
what the input file should look like is <a HREF=TS.com>TS.com<a>.
</ul>
<p>
<li Type=1> We run Gaussian to optimize the transition state.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>
<font color=red>localhost:~>g98 TS.com</font><br><br>
<li>
copy the optimized cartesian coordinate section of the output file
(TS.log) and paste them into emacs. Modify the file such that it can
be read by Molden. The cartesian format for Molden is as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
line 1: number of atoms<br>
line 2: blank<br>
line 3: Atomsymbol x y z<br>
line 4: Atomsymbol x y z<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
and so on. The last line needs to be blank!<br>save the file as
TS.xyz. An example of what this file should look like is <a
HREF=TS.xyz>TS.xyz</a>

<li> open the cartesian coordinate file with the optimizaed transition
state structure with molden<br><font color=red>localhost:~>molden TS.xyz</font>

<blockquote>
<img SRC=../molden/step5.jpg ALT="">
</blockquote>
<p>
Note: the Nitrogen atom is not completely SP2 hybridized (planar) in
this geometry, but rather a slightly SP3 hybridized (pyramidal). This
is a known shortcoming of the <i>semi-empirical</i> PM3
hamiltonian. We ignore this artefact for now and continue with a
slightly pyramidal N atom.
</ul>
<a NAME="freq">
<li Type=1> We check if the structure obtained is a true transition
state<br><br>
<ul>
<li>perform a freqency analysis on the optimized coordinates. The
frequencies, or normal modes, are the eigenvalues of the
HEssian. Remember that for a transition state, one and only one of
these eigenvalues needs to be negative. The inputfile for that looks
as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black>
%chk=TS<br> #P PM3 FREQ geom=check TEST<br>
<br>
frequency calculation<br>
<br>
0 1<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
 
<p>
The coordinates are read form the checkpointfile (TS.chk, geom=check).
Save the file as TS_freq.com

<p>
<li>
<font color=red>localhost:~>g98 TS_freq.com</font><br><br>
<li>
check the output for imaginary freqencies. If there is one and only
one, it means we found a transition state! From the visual inspection
we learned it is the correct one, as the structure resembles what one
would expect to be the transition state for the Diels-Alder
cyclo-addition.

<a NAME="react">
<h1>Optimizing the reactant state geometry in <i>vacuo</i></h1>

<p>
Now that we have the transition state, we are going to optimize the
reactant state geometry in <i>vacuo</i>. We start from the input file
we created for optimizing the transition state. 

<p>
We simple increase a bit more the bond lengths of the bonds that are
to be formed upon the cycloaddition reaction and start an geometry
optimization.
<ul>

<li>open the TS.com input file in a text editor<br> <font color=red>localhost:~>emacs
TS.com</font><br><br> 

<li>increase the cc3 and cc5 bond lengths to 4 in the TS.com input
file (<font face="courier" color=black>cc3 4.000000</font> and <font
face="courier" color=black>cc5 4.000000</font>)<br><br>

<li>change the <font face="courier"
color=black>OPT=(TS,noeigentest)</font> command option to <font
face="courier" color=black>OPT</font>, so that gaussian "knows" it is
supposed to find a minimum with all negative eigenvalues of the
hessian.<br><br>

<li>save the
file to REACT.com<br><br>

<li><font color=red>localhost:~>g98 REACT.com</font><br><br>

<li>
copy the optimized cartesian coordinate section of the output file
(REACT.log) and paste them into emacs. Modify the file such that it
can be read by Molden. The cartesian format for Molden is as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
line 1: number of atoms<br> line 2: blank<br> line 3: Atomsymbol x y
z<br> line 4: Atomsymbol x y z<br>
</blockquote>
and so on... Note that the last line needs to be blank! Save the file
as REACT.xyz. An example is found here: <a
HREF=REACT.xyz>REACT.xyz</a>.<br><br>

<li> open the cartesian coordinate file with the optimized reactant
minimum structure with molden to have a look at the reactants<br>
(<font color=red>localhost:~>molden REACT.xyz</font>)

<a NAME="prod">
<h1>Optimizing the product state geometry in <i>vacuo</i></h1>

<p>
Again, we start from the Transition state optimization input. This
time we want to have the product geometry in <i>vacuo</i>. We now
decrease slightly the bond lengths of the bonds that are to be formed
upon the cycloaddition reaction and start an geometry optimization.

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>
We have now optimized the geometries and energies of the transition
state, the reactant state and the prodcut state of the Diels-Alder
cycloaddition. The energies of these structures can be found by
scanning the gaussian output files (.log) for lines that start with
"Energy". The last one is the energy of the optimized structure. Note,
the energies are reported in atomic units (au): 1 au = 2625.4999999
kJ/mol. Table 1 lists the potential energies of the optimized
geomtries.

<p>
The structures we optimized here at a <i>semi-empirical</i> level are
a good starting point for optimizations at higher levels of theory. A
good rule of the thumb in optimizing structures is to start with a
very low level of theory an gradually increase the level of theory
using the optimized geometry of the previous level (<i>i.e.</i>
PM3, STO-3G, 3-21G, 3-21G*, ...., 6-31G*, ..., ...)
