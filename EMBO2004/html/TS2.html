<h1>I. Optimization of the product, reactant and transition state
geometries in <i>vacuo</i></h1>
<p>
<strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>
A transition state optimization can be found in many ways. With some
intuition, we can make a good guess of what the Transition State
should look like and start the optimization from there.
<p>
Another possibily is to define a coordinate which transforms the
reactants into product and optimize the system while varying that
coordinate. Choosing such reaction coordinate requires some intuition
and understanding of the process studied, but is in general easier to
chose than a reasonable guess geometry. The concept of the reaction
coordinate is best explained by an example. In case of a Diels Alder
Cyclo-addition, a good reaction coordinate would be the distance
between the two atom pairs that are forming the two new bonds upon
reaction.

<blockquote>
<i><strong>Figure 3.</strong></i> Suitable Reaction Coordinate for a
Diels-Alder reaction. The distance between the centers of the atom
pairs involved in the cyclo-addition is restrained or constrained,
while all other degrees of freedom are minimized.
</blockquote>

Once the reaction coordinate is choosen, we slowly progresses along
that coordinate while minimizing all other degrees of freedom. In
practice, the reaction coordinate is constrained or restrained at a
number of distances. Afterwards, the potential energy is plotted as a
function the reaction coordinate. The maximum of this curve is the
transition state and the minima the reactant and product states. We
can check this by taking the structures corresponding to those
stationary points and perfom a transition state and two normal
optimizations. This approach is called Linear Transit.
<p>
In this part of the tutorial we will search for the transition state,
using a good guess geometry. In the next part we will use the Linear
Transit approach.

<a NAME="TS1">
<h1>Optimize the transition state geometry in <i>vacuo</i>, starting
with a good guess.</h1>

<p>
We will start by optimizing the transition state of the Diels-Alder
reaction in vacuo at the <i>semi-empirical</i> PM3 level. This is easy
since we already have the struture of the transition state
analogue. We simply take the coordinates of that analogue from the
x-ray structure (<a
HREF=http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pid=128791089897524&pdbId=1C1E>1C1E.pdb</a>)
and modify them a bit, such that we get the appropriate input
coordinates for a <a HREF=http://www.gaussian.com>Gaussian03</a>
transition-state optimization calculation. We will use the
<i>semi-empirical</i> PM3 hamiltonian throughout this tutorial,
because of its cost-efficiency. Note that in the x-ray structure the
-R group of the analogue (Figure 1) is not resolved. We ignore that
group for the moment and focus on the system with -R = -CH3.

<p>
The following steps will lead us to the transition state geometry of
the reaction in <i>vacuo</i>.
<p>
<ul>
<li Type=1> We download <a
HREF=http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pid=128791089897524&pdbId=1C1E>1C1E.pdb</a>
x-ray structure from the pdbdatabase<br><br>

<li Type=1> We use rasmol to isolate the transition state analogue (ENH)<br><br>
<ul>
<li> open 1C1E.pdb with rasmol<br>
(localhost:~>rasmol 1C1E.pdb)

<br><br>
<img SRC=../rasmol/step1.jpg ALT="" >
<br><br>
<li> select the TS analogue exclusively <br>(RasMol>restrict ENH)
<br><br>
<li> center the analogue <br>(RasMol>center selected)
<br><br>
<li> zoom in on the analogue <br>(RasMol>zoom 600) 
<br><br>
<img SRC=../rasmol/step2.jpg ALT="" >
<br><br>
<li> save the analogue in a seperate pbd-file<br>(Rasmol>save analogue.pdb)
</ul>
<br><br>
<li Type=1> We use MOLDEN to create an gaussian inputfile for a transition state optimization from analogue.pdb
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> open analogue.pdb with MOLDEN <br>
(localhost:~>molden -P analogue.pdb) with the -P option MOLDEN expects pdb format as input. 
<br><br>
<img SRC=../molden/step1.jpg hsize=50><br><br>

<li> click the stickcolor button in the Molden Control window to
display the atoms in different colors<br><br>

<img SRC=../molden/step1b_small.jpg  ALT="">
<img SRC=../molden/toolbox.jpg  ALT=""><br><br>

<li> click on the Zmat editor button to enter the Z-matrix
editor<br><br>

<img SRC=../molden/zmatrixbox1.jpg<br><br>

<li> click on the "select by cursor" button in the Zmat editor and
select all atoms in the molecule visualiztion window by draging a box
around them with the mouse pointer. Click the "apply selection" button
to complete the selection. A Z-matrix represents the geometry in terms
of distances, angles and torsions. For instance, atom 7, is a Nitrogen
atom. The distance of this atom to atom 6 is A; the angle between this
atom and atoms 6 and 3 is 110 degrees and the torsion angle between
this atoms and atoms 6, 3 and 4 is 0.757 degrees.<br><br> 

<img SRC=../molden/zmatrixbox2.jpg <br><br> 

<li> increase a bit the lengths of the two bonds that are supposed to
be formed in the Diels-Alder reaction (C4-C5 and C2-C3).  Change the
values of the bondlengths of C5-C4 and C3-C2 to, say 2 angstrom in the
Z-matrix. Now the molecule resembes the actual Transition State a bit
better already.<br><br>

<img SRC=../molden/step2_small.jpg  ALT="">
<img SRC=../molden/zmatrix_step2_small.jpg  ALT=""><br><br>

<li> next, change the atoms of the analogue to the atoms of the actual
Transition State. Simple click on the atomname entries in the Z-matrix
editor and change them to the appropriate atoms. Click on the "apply
changes to current Z-mat" button for the changes to take
effect.<br><br>

<img SRC=../molden/step2b_small.jpg  ALT="">
<img SRC=../molden/zmatrix_step2b_small.jpg ALT=""><br><br>

<li> saturate the complex with hydrogens. Use the "add line" button to
chose a hydrogen atoms and add them to the molecule by clicking on the
unsaturated atoms first followed by clicking two more atoms to define
an angle and a torsion respectively. The result should look like
this:<br><br>

<img SRC=../molden/step4.jpg ALT=""><br><br>

<li> save the Z-matrix into a gaussian format. Clicking the "Gaussian"
buttom at the bottom of the editor, type a name (<i>e.g.</i> TS.com)
in the "File name ?" window and click the "write Z-matrix"
button.<br><br>

<img SRC=../molden/zmatrix_step4.jpg ALT=""><br><br>

<li> quit molden by clicking the skull icon in the Molden COntrol
window<br><br>
</ul>


<li Type=1> The next step is to make an input file for Gaussian. We
use an ordinary text editor, such as emacs to complete the input file.<br><br>

<ul>
<li> open TS.com with emacs<br> (localhost:~>rasmol 1C1E.pdb)<br><br>


<li> add the gaussian keywords for a transition state optimization (#P
PM3 OPT=(TS,noeigentest) TEST) and compete the input file. We use a
so-called checkpoint file (TS.chk, first line) to store all optimized
parameters. The input file should look like:

<p>
<blockquote>

Note: the Nitrogen atom is not completely SP2 hybridized (planar) in
this geometry, but rather a slightly SP3 hybridized (pyramidal). This
is a known shortcoming of the <i>semi-empirical</i> PM3
hamiltonian. We ignore this artefact for now and continue with a
slightly pyramidal N atom.

<h1>Optimize the transition state in <i>vacuo</i>, using a reaction
coordinate</h1>

<p>
We will now do a so-called linear transit computation, using the
reaction coordinate of figure 3. We constrain the distance between the
centers of the atompairs involved in the reaction and minimize all
other degrees of freedom. We repeat this many times at different
constraintlegths. The way we impose our constraint, is to put a dummy,
atom, with no interaction whatsoever with any other atom of the system
exactly in the middle of the atompairs (figure 3). The dummy is
constructed every step of the simulation/optimization, so that it is
always exaclty in the at the centre. The dummy-dummy distance is then
constrained. Note, in the current version of gromacs, constraints
between dummies is not implemented yet, so we will use a trick
here. The trick is explained <a HREF=trick.html>here</a>.  For now, it
is not important to know the details of this trick. Furthermore, in a
next release of gromacs it will be possible already to apply the
dummy-dummy constraints we need here.

<p>
What we need to do is to make many different subdirectories, one for
every linear-transit point. At every linear-transit point we need to
use a different constraint lenght:

Now that we have the transition state, we are going to optimize the
reactant state geometry in <i>vacuo</i>. We start from the input file

We simple increase a bit more the bond lengths of the bonds that are
to be formed upon the cycloaddition reaction and start an geometry
optimization.

<h1>Optimizing the product state geometry in <i>vacuo</i></h1>

<p>
Again, we start from the Transition state optimization input. This
time we want to have the product geometry in <i>vacuo</i>. We now

upon the cycloaddition reaction and start an geometry optimization.

<p>
We have now optimized the geometries and energies of the transition
state, the reactant state and the prodcut state of the Diels-Alder
cycloaddition. The energies of these structures can be found by
scanning the gaussian output files (.log) for lines that start with
"Energy". The last one is the energy of the optimized structure. Note,
the energies are reported in atomic units (au): 1 au = 2625.4999999
kJ/mol. Table 1 lists the potential energies of the optimized
geomtries.

<blockquote>

<p>
The structures we optimized here at a <i>semi-empirical</i> level are
a good starting point for optimizations at higher levels of theory. A
good rule of the thumb in optimizing structures is to start with a
very low level of theory an gradually increase the level of theory
using the optimized geometry of the previous level (<i>i.e.</i>
PM3, STO-3G, 3-21G, 3-21G*, ...., 6-31G*, ..., ...)
