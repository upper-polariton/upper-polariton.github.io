<h1>II. Optimization of the product, reactant and transition state geometries in the fully solvated protein</h1>


<p>
<strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>
Having optimized a transition state
structure in the vacuum, we will use that result as a starting point
for the optimization of the transition state in the protein. We fit
the vacuum transition state onto the transition state analogue in the
pocket of the x-ray protein model. Remember that in the x-ray model,
the -R group of the analogue was not resolved. We need to add the
chain ourselves. The simplest way to do this is to add the chain to
the transition state structure before fitting. Adding the tail can be
done with Molden. After the fit, we minimize the tail keeping all
other atoms in the system frozen.
<p>
We then place this modified protein model in a periodic box, fill that
box with water and equilibrate the water. Subsequently, we add 6 Cl-
ions to compensate the overall net charge of -6 on the protein and
equilibrate again. The procedure of preparing the system for the QM/MM
geometry optimization is straightforward, but
time-consuming. Therefore, we skip fitting and equilibrating and use
the result (<a HREF=../protein/confin.gro>confin.gro</a>) instead. An
outline of the preparation is avalaible <a HREF=prepqmmm.html>here</a>
for future reference.

<p>

<strong>QM/MM subdivision</strong>
<p>
The fully solvated protein system is too large for even a
<i>semi-empirical</i> QM calculation. Therefore, we resort to a QM/MM
description f the system. We split up the system in a small QM part
and a much bigger MM part, as is shown in figure 3. The QM part
consists of the same atoms we were using in the vacuum calculations
and is described at the <i>semi-empirical</i> PM3 level of theory. The
remainder of the system, consisting of the tail part (-R, figure 1) of
the reactants, the protein, the water molecules and the chloride ions,
is modeled with the GROMOS96 forcefield.

subsystem and an MM subsystem. The QM subsystem is described at the
<i>semi-empirical</i> QM level, while the remainder of the system,
consisting of the reactants-aliphatic tail, protein, water molecules
and ions is modeled with the GROMOS96 forcefield.
</blockquote>

<p>
The QM/MM division splits the systems along a chemical
bond. Therefore, we need to cap the QM subsystem with a so-called link
atom (la, figure 3). This link atom is present as a hydrogen atom in
the QM calculation step. It is not physically present in the MM
subsystem, but the forces on it, that are computed in the QM step, are
distributed over the two atoms of the bond. The bondlength itself is
constrained during the computations.

<p>

To make use of the QM/MM functionality in Gromacs, we have to
<ul>
<li>
<a HREF="#topol"> introduce link atoms at the QM/MM boundary, if
needed</a>;
<li>
<a HREF="#ndx"> specify which atoms are to be treated at a QM
level</a>;
<li>
<a HREF="#mdp">specify the QM level, basisset, type of QM/MM interface
and so on</a>.
</ul>


<a NAME="topol">
<strong>adding link atoms</strong>
<p>
At the bond that connects the QM and MM subsystems we introduce a link
atom. In Gromacs we make use of a special atomtype, called LA. This
atomtype is treated as a hydrogen atom in the QM calculation, and as a
dummy atom in the forcefield calculation. The link atoms, if any, are
part of the system, but have no interaction with any other atom,
expect that the QM force working on it is distributed over the two
atoms of the bond. In the topology the link atom (LA), therefore, is
defined as a dummy atom:
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black>
[ dummies2 ]   <br>
LA  QMatom MMatom 1 0.65<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Note, a link atom has no mass.
<br>
Furthermore, the bond itself is replaced by a constraint:
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black>
[ constraints ]   <br>
QMatom MMatom 2 0.153<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Note, for our system the constraint length is chosen to represent the
carbon-carbon distance (0.153 nm). If the QM and MM subsystems are
connected by a different kind of bond, a different constraint lenght,
appropriate for that bond type, is required.<br>The QM/MM topology
file for the reactants shown in figure 3 is found here: <a
HREF=../protein/topol_A.itp>topol_A.itp</a>.
<p>
<a NAME="ndx">
<strong>specifying the QM atoms</strong>
<p>
Once we have decided which atoms should be treated by a QM method, we
add these atoms, including the link atoms, if any, to the index
file. We can either use the make_ndx program, or hack the atoms into
the index.ndx file ourselves. The index file we will use in this
tutorial is found here: <a HREF=../protein/index.ndx>index.ndx</a>. It
is possible to constrain the bonds in the QM subsystem along. It is
also possible not to constrain them, while the bonds in the MM
subsystem are. This is essential for instance if the QM atoms are
supposed to undergo bond-breaking/formation reactions. In this case,
Gromacs' bondtype 5 is used for the bonds in the QM subsystem:
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black>
[ bonds ]   <br>
QMatom1 QMatom2 5<br>
QMatom2 QMatom3 5<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a NAME="mdp">
<strong>specifying the QM/MM simulation parameters</strong>
<p>
The last thing we need to do to setup gromacs for performing QM/MM
calculations is to specify what level of QM theory gromacs has to use
for the QM subsystem, what QM/MM interface to use, what multiplicity
the QM subsystem has, and so on. All these things are defined in the
mdp file. The following option lines need to be included for a QM/MM
run:
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black >
QMMM                     = yes<br>
QMMM-grps                = QMatoms<br>
QMmethod                 = RHF<br>
QMbasis                  = 3-21G*<br>
QMMMscheme               = ONIOM<br>
QMcharge                 = 0<br>
QMmult                   = 1<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Note that the default options are shown here. The actual options
depend on the system. The mdp file we will use for the QM/MM
transition state optimization is located here: <a
HREF=../protein/TS.mdp>TS.mdp</a>. In case one choses as the QMmethod
a <i>semi-empirical</i> method, such as AM1 or PM3, the QMbasis is
ignored.


<p>
Now that we know how QM/MM works in Gromacs, we will use it to carry
the following steps:

<li Type=> <a HREF="#TS">Optimize the transition state in the protein
</a><br><br>

<li Type=> <a HREF="#react">Optimize the reactant state in the protien
</a><br><br>
<li Type=> <a HREF="#prod">Optimize the product state in the protein

</ul>

<h1>Optimizing the transition state geometry in the protein</h1>

We are going to perform a QM/MM transition state optimization on the
protein-substrate complex to get the transition state geometry of the
catalyzed Diels-Alder cycloaddition in the enzyme's active site. The
coordinates, topologies, index file and mdp file have been prepared
already.

<p>
<ul>
<li Type=1>Download diels-alderase.tar.gz. This archive contains the
input files for gromacs. Unpack the file<br><br>
localhost:~>gunzip diels-alderase.tar.gz<br><br>
localhost:~>tar -xvf diels-alderase.tar.gz<br><br>
or alternatively all at once by:<br><br>
localhost:~>tar -zxvf diels-alderase.tar.gz<br><br>

<li Type=1>The options in TS.mdp are set such that gromacs optimizes
the transition state. Let's have a look at that file before we
proceed. We see that the integrator is TS, which means that gromacs is
supposed to find a transition state geometry. Furthermore, we use the
ONIOM QM/MM interface and a <i>semi-empirical</i> PM3 method for the
QM subsystem. We define multiple energy_grps, so that we can
afterwards easily determine the interactions between these different
groups. With the grompp preprocessor we create a binary inputfile for
gromacs<br><br> localhost:~>grompp -f TS.mdp -c confin.gro -n index.ndx -p
topol.top -o topol_TS.tpr<br><br>

<li Type=1>Use the mdrun programm with the inputfile generated to
perform the actual optimization. This will take a while to
complete.<br><br> localhost:~>mdrun -s topol_TS.tpr -c confout_TS.gro
-e ener_TS.ene -o traj_TS.trr -x traj_TS.xtc -g md_TS.log<br><br>

<li Type=1>When mdrun is finished succesfully, there should be a file
called confout.gro. This file contains the optimized coordinates of
the total system. Let's have a look at the system with rasmol. We need
to convert the confout.gro file into pdb format. We can use the
gromacs tool editconf<br><br> localhost:~>editconf -f confout_TS.gro
-o confout_TS.pdb<br><br> We then read in the confout.pdb file with
rasmol<br><br> localhost:~>rasmol confout_TS.pdb<br><br> let's leave

<h1>Optimizing the reactant state geometry in the protein</h1>

Simply running a normal geomtry optimization from the same coordinates
we used for the Transition State optimization results in the product
geometry. The overall potential energy of this minimum is lower, and
therefore more likely to be found. The prodcut geomerty is the aim of
the next step (<a NAME="prod">Optimizing the product state geometry in
the protein</a>) in this tutorial. In this step, we want to optimize
the geometry of the reactants. 
<p>

<ul>
<li Type=1>
Manipulating the starting structure, which consists of the protein,
watermolecules, ions and reactants in the transition state, is not as
simple as it was before in vacuo. Therefore we try a different
approach. We simply start a very short QM/MM molecular dynamics
simulation, just as we will do in the next part of the tutorial. The
starting point of these simulations is the transition state structure
we just have obtained in the previous step. The details of the
simulations we will address fully there. For now, it is enough that we
understand that instead of an optimization, we can also perform a
molecular dynamics simulation by replacing the TS integrator by the md
integrator in the mdp file:
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black>
integrator = md <br> nsteps = 500<br> timestep = 0.001<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Let's try it. We will use the random velocity generation of Gromacs,
to generate the initial velocities for the simulation. It is possible
that the outcome of the simulation will be the product state instead
of the reactant state. In that case we will rerun the simulation with
different starting velocities by using a different <font
face="courier" color=black>gen_seed</font> in the mdpfile.

<p>

<ul>
<li>Make a different subdirectory, named runs.<br><br>
localhost:~>mkdir runs<br><br> Copy the optimized transition state
complex TS.mdp file to this dir.<br><br>
localhost:~>cp TS.mdp runs<br><br>

<li>go into the runs subdir and modify the TS.mdp file as
indicated above using a text editor and save the resulting file as
run_REACT.mdp.<br><br>

<li>We create a binary inputfile for gromacs with grompp
preprocessor, using the topologies, indexfile and outcome of the
previous step<br><br> localhost:~>grompp -f run_REACT.mdp -c
../confout_TS.gro -n ../index.ndx -p ../topol.top -o
topol_run_REACT.tpr<br><br>

<li>Use the mdrun program with the inputfile generated to
perform the actual 500 ps molecular dynamics simulation. This will
take a while to complete.<br><br> localhost:~>mdrun -s topol_TS.tpr -c
confout_run_REACT.gro -e ener_run_REACT.ene -o traj_run_REACT.trr -x
traj_run_REACT.xtc -g md_run_REACT.log<br><br>

<li>Afterwards, we inspect the outcome visually. We first
isolate the reactants coordinates from the confout_run_REACT.gro using
the gromacs tool editconf:
<br><br> localhost:~>editconf -f confout_run_REACT.gro -o dat.pdb<br><br>
Then we open the dat.pdb file with rasmol
<br><br> localhost:~>rasmol dat.pdb<br><br>

<img SRC=../rasmol/protein_step2.jpg ALT=""><br><br> 

<li>If the structure resembles the reactant state, <i>i.e.</i>,
the two reactant molecules are no longer chemically bound together, we
proceed to step 2. If the structure resembles more the product (see
below), we try another simulation with a different gen_seed.
</ul>
<p>
<li Type=1>Using the outcome of the short simulation, we perform a
geometry optimization to obtain the reactant mimimum. 
<p>
<ul>
<li>copy the confout_run_REACT.gro to confin_REACT.gro<br><br>
localhost:~>cp confout_run_REACT.gro ../confin_REACT.gro<br><br>
<li>Alter the integrator in the TS.mdp file to OPT (<font
face="courier" color=black> integrator = OPT </font>)and save the file
as REACT.mdp<br><br>
<li>

gromacs<br><br> localhost:~>grompp -f REACT.mdp -c confin_REACT.gro -n

<li Type=1>When mdrun is finished succesfully, we have a look at the
result again. <br><br> localhost:~>editconf -f confout_REACT.gro -o
