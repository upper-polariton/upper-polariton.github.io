<h1>V. Conclusions, Discussion and Outlook</h1>
<p>
We have performed a number of QMMM calculations on a Diels-Alder
cycloaddition. We have seen that the reaction barrier decreases when
going from vacuum to water and from water to the catalytic
antibody. The conclusion so far are that the protein catalyzes the
cycloaddition by stabilizing the transition state with respect to the
reactant state. See table 5 and figure 9 for details. However, there a
few critical points that have not been addressed.

First of all, we have used a Steepest Descent algorithm to do the
energy minimizations. This algorithm, however, is known not to
converge very well near a minimum. This was one of the reasons for
increasing the convergence criteria. A better algortithm for
minimization would be the BGFS algorithm, which employs higer order
derivatives, but is much more expensive in terms of computational
costs. It would give more accurate results though, which is the
primary reason for using it.
<p>
Second, the results happen to be very sensitive with respect to the
initial conditions. Slighly different starting configurations would
result in different potential energy curves. This is another
consequence of using the simple Steepest Descent method for
minimization.
<p>
Third, real reaction barriers are Free Energy barriers. With the
current setup for the Linear Transit is is possible to do a free
energy calculation. We need to define a State A and a State B, where A
and B represent the reactant and product configuration
respectively. The constraint between the Dummy atoms in state A would
be 0.14 and in state B 0.3. To actually perform a QM/MM Free Energy
calculation, one needs to specify both the A and B state parameters in
the constraint section of the topology file:
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black>
[ constraints ] <br> 
; atom1 atom2 type stateA stateB<br>
QMatom MMatom    2   0.14  0.3  <br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Furthermore, one needs to 'tell' gromacs it is supposed to do a free
energy perturbation calculation by addig the lines (see <a HREF=http://www.gromacs.org/documentation/reference_3.1/online/mdp_opt.html#free>gmx manual</a>).
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black>
free_energy = yes<br>
init_lambda = 0<br>
delta_lambda = 0.01<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
to the mdp file. The calculations will be more time consuming, but the
result is the free energy curve of the reaction, which is easier to
relate to experimental data than the potential energy curves we
computed thus far. But the tutorial was aimed to give a more
qualitative picture of the reaction rather than a quantitative one.
<p>
We hope you enjoyed doing this tutorial and that you found it useful
for your own work now or in the future. Of course, the system used in
the tutorial was a rather easy starting point as the transition state
analogue was known, but the techniques you learned should work without
such knowledge as well. If, while performing QM/MM calculations you
run into trouble, or would like to discuss something, you can always
contact me.
