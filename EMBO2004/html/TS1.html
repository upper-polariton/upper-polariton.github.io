<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>

The essence of biological catalysis is the complementarity between the
transition state of the process catalyzed and the enzyme. The
transition state "fits" perfectly into the enzyme's active site pocket
and is therefore stabilized, which enhances the reaction rate. The
essence of our immune system is also complementarity, but in this case
it is the complementarity between the antigen, a compound that should
not be inside your body, and the antibody. Upon exposure to an antigen
the immune system generates immunoglobins that can bind the antigen
and thereby make it harmless. This natural immuno response can be
exploited to generate so-called antibody catalysts for chemical
reactions. The immune system is triggered by exposing it to a compound
that mimicks the transition state of the reaction of interest. Such a
compound is called a transition state analogue. Even though it
structurally resembles the transition state, it is a stable molecule.
The generated immunoglobins will strongly bind to the analogue, and,
as the analogue is structurally related to the transition state of the
reaction, the immunoglobins will posses a certain degree of catalytic
activity for that reaction.

In this tutorial we are going to study a catalytic antibody that
catalyzes the Diels Alder cyclo-addition reaction shown here. The
x-ray structure of the analogue-antibody complex has been determined
by Xu <i>et al</i>. (Science 286 (1999), 2345-2348) and is available
from the <a HREF=http://www.rcsb.org>protein databank</a>.

The tutorial is aimed at learning the elementary QM and QM/MM skills
one needs for studying enzymes. The tutorial consists of three parts
<ul>

<li Type=I> <a HREF=./TS2.html#top>Optimization of the product, reactant and transition state
geometries in vacuo</a>;

<li Type=I> <a HREF=./TS3.html#top>Optimization of the product, reactant and transition state
geometries in the fully solvated protein</a>;

<li Type=I> Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the reaction, using the
transition states as starting points;

<li Type=I> Calculation of the reaction rate based on the Eyring
equation, using the outcome of the simulations and optimizations.

</ul>

In this tutorial the optimization of the transition states is rather
straightforward, as the analogue is known. However, if you have never
optimized a transition state before, the optimizations in this
tutorial are a good starting point to develop your skills.
