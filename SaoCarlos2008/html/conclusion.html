<h1>VIII. Concluding remarks</h1>
<p>

We have performed QM/MM MD simulations of DNA with a thymine dimer
lesion. We have seen that electron uptake by the dimer leads to a
rapid breaking of one of the bonds holding the dimer together. There
is a barrier for the second bond to break. To accelerate the barrier
crossing we have used the flooding technique. From the strength of the
flooding potential and the time it took to overcome the barrier, one
can estimate an upper bound to the barrier height. If you are
interested in this we recommend you to read the papers by Helmut
Grubmueller, who has developed the flooding technique.
<p>
From the flooding simulation we can infer the reaction mechanism. The
flooding trajectory thus provides a good starting point for more advanced
methods, such as umbrella sampling, or transition path sampling.
<p>
 We hope you enjoyed doing this tutorial and that you found it useful
for your own work now or in the future. If, while performing QM/MM
calculations you run into trouble, or would like to discuss something,
you can always contact me.
