<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Intra-strand thymine dimerization (Figure 1) is recognized as
the most common process leading to DNA damage under
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The formation of thymine dimers has
potentially important physiological consequences. This mutagenic
photoproduct can disrupt the function of DNA and thereby trigger
complex biological responses, including apoptosis, immune
suppression, and carcinogenesis.

formation of a Thymine dimer, as shown in these snapshots from
an <i>ab initio</i> MD simulation.

To survive exposure to UV radiation, organisms have evolved complex
mechanisms to repair damaged DNA. The initial step is detection of a
damage spot, the thymine dimer for instance. Subsequently, the dimer
can be either repaired, or removed. Photolyase is an enzyme that
detects the dimer site by binding to it and then catalyses the
splitting of the dimer into the original pyrimidine bases (Figure
2). Photolyase contains a reduced flavin co-enzyme co-factor that upon
absorption of UV light donates an electron to the bound Thyime
dimer. The excess electron destabilizes the dimer, and facilitates the
slitting of the cyclobutane ring. After the original thymine bases are
restored, the electron flows back onto the flavin.

bases.

Thymine dimers can also be restored without the Photolyase. In this
so-called self-repair process, the dimer splits upon spontaneous
uptake of an electron. Depending on the base sequence, such electrons
can be readily available. In this tutorial we will examine this self
repair process by means of <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics
simulations.
