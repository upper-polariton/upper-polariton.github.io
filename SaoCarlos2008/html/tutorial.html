<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Intra-strand thymine dimerization (Figure 1) is recognized as
the most common process leading to DNA damage under
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The formation of thymine dimers has
potentially important physiological consequences. This mutagenic
photoproduct can disrupt the function of DNA and thereby trigger
complex biological responses, including apoptosis, immune
suppression, and carcinogenesis.

an <i>ab initio</i> MD simulation.

To survive exposure to UV radiation, organisms have evolved complex
mechanisms to repair damaged DNA. The initial step is usually the
detection of a damage spot, a thymine dimer for
instance. Subsequently, the dimer is either repaired, or completely
removed.
<p>
Photolyase is an enzyme that detects the dimer site by binding to it
and then catalyses the splitting of the dimer into the original
pyrimidine bases (Figure 2). Photolyase contains a reduced flavin
co-enzyme co-factor that upon absorption of UV light donates an
electron to the bound Thyime dimer. The excess electron destabilizes
the dimer, and facilitates the slitting of the cyclobutane ring. After
the original thymine bases are restored, the electron flows back onto
the flavin and Photolyase is ready to repair the next lesion.

bases (red).

Thymine dimers can also be restored without the help of Photolyase. In
this so-called self-repair process, the dimer splits upon spontaneous
uptake of an electron. Depending on the base sequence, such electrons
are readily available. In this tutorial we will examine the self
repair process by means of <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics
simulations.

needs for studying biological systems. The tutorial consists of eight
