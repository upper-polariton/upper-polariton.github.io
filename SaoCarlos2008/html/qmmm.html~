<h1>III. Setting up the system for QM/MM simulation with gromacs</h1>
<p>
<a NAME="intro">
<strong>QM/MM subdivision</strong>
<p>
We will now set up the system to be simulated at the QM/MM level with
Gromacs. The Thymine bases will be described at the semi-empirical AM1
level of theory, while the remainder of the system is still modeled
with the Amber99 forcefield. Figure 4 shows how we split up our system
in a QM and MM part.

forcefield.

<p>
The QM/MM division splits the systems along a chemical
bond. Therefore, we need to cap the QM subsystem with a so-called link
atom (la, figure 4). This link atom is present as a hydrogen atom in
the QM calculation step. It is not physically present in the MM
subsystem, but the forces on it, that are computed in the QM step, are
distributed over the two atoms of the bond. The bondlength itself is
constrained during the computations.

To make use of the QM/MM functionality in Gromacs, we have to
<ul>
<li>
<a HREF="#topol"> introduce link atoms at the QM/MM boundary, if
needed</a>;
<li>
<a HREF="#ndx"> specify which atoms are to be treated at a QM
level</a>;
<li>
<a HREF="#mdp">specify the QM level, basisset, type of QM/MM interface
and so on</a>.
</ul>

<a NAME="topol">
<strong>adding link atoms</strong>
<p>
At the bond that connects the QM and MM subsystems we introduce a link
atom. In Gromacs we make use of a special atomtype, called LA. This
atomtype is treated as a hydrogen atom in the QM calculation, and as a
dummy atom in the forcefield calculation. The link atoms, if any, are
part of the system, but have no interaction with any other atom,
except that the QM force working on it is distributed over the two
atoms of the bond. In the topology the link atom (LA), therefore, is
defined as a dummy atom:
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black>
[ dummies2 ] <br> LA QMatom MMatom 1 0.73<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Note, a link atom has no mass.
<br>
Furthermore, the bond itself is replaced by a constraint:
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black>
[ constraints ] <br> QMatom MMatom 2 0.153<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Note that, because in our system the QM/MM bond is a carbon-nitrogen
bond (0.153 nm), we use a constraint length of 0.153 nm, and dummy
position of 0.65. The latter is the ratio between the ideal C-H
bondlength and the ideal C-C bond length. With this ratio, the link
atom is always 0.1 nm away from the QMatom, consistent with the
carbon-hydrogen bondlength. If the QM and MM subsystems are connected
by a different kind of bond, a different constraint and a different
dummy position, appropriate for that bond type, are required. Note
that because the link atoms are constructed at each step of the
simulation, it is not relevant a what position the link atoms are
introduced in the configuration file. Thus, we can simply place the
two linkatoms at the origin (0,0,0). Click to have a look at what the
<a HREF=./files/qmmm1.gro>structure</a> and
<a HREF=./files/qmmm.top>topology</a> files should look like for a
QM/MM simulation.

here: <a HREF=./files/qmmm.top>qmmm.top</a>.
<p>
<a NAME="ndx">
<strong>specifying the QM atoms</strong>
<p>
Once we have decided which atoms should be treated by a QM method, we
add these atoms, including the link atoms, if any, to the index
file. We can either use the make_ndx program, or hack the atoms into
the index.ndx file ourselves. The index file we will use in this
tutorial is found here: <a HREF=./files/qmmm.ndx>qmmm.ndx</a>. It
is possible to constrain the bonds in the QM subsystem along. It is
also possible not to constrain them, while the bonds in the MM
subsystem are. This is essential for instance if the QM atoms are
supposed to undergo bond-breaking/formation reactions. In this case,
Gromacs' bondtype 5 is used for the bonds in the QM subsystem:
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black>
[ bonds ]   <br>
QMatom1 QMatom2 5<br>
QMatom2 QMatom3 5<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a NAME="mdp">
<strong>specifying the QM/MM simulation parameters</strong>
<p>
The last thing we need to do to setup gromacs for performing QM/MM
calculations is to specify what level of QM theory gromacs has to use
for the QM subsystem, what QM/MM interface to use, what multiplicity
the QM subsystem has, and so on. All these things are defined in the
mdp file. The following option lines need to be included for a QM/MM
run:
<blockquote>
<font face="courier" color=black >
QMMM                     = yes<br>
QMMM-grps                = QMatoms<br>
QMmethod                 = RHF<br>
QMbasis                  = 3-21G*<br>
QMMMscheme               = ONIOM<br>
QMcharge                 = 0<br>
QMmult                   = 1<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Note that the default options are shown here. The actual options
depend on the system. The mdp file we will use for the short QM/MM
equilibrtion simulation is located here:
<a HREF=../vacuum/qmmm1.mdp>qmmm1.mdp</a>. In case one choses as the
QMmethod a <i>semi-empirical</i> method, such as AM1 or PM3, the
QMbasis is ignored.

<a NAME="LT1">
<strong>QM/MM MD simulation</strong>
<p>
We now perform a short 1ps QM/MM equilibration simulation of the system. 
<p>
<font color=red>localhost:~>grompp -f qmmm1.mdp -p qmmm.top -n
qmmm.ndx -c qmmm1.gro
<p>
<font color=red>localhost:~>mdrun -v -o
<a href=./files/qmmm1out.gro><qmmm1out.gro</a>
</font>
<p>
We will use the structure after 1 ps of MD as the starting point

Then, we equilibrate the water and ions for 100 ps, using the
parameter in <a href=./files/equi_sol.mdp>equi_sol.mpd</a>. The heavy
atoms of the DNA are <a href=./files/posres.itp>restrained</a>  during the
solvent equilibration.
<p>
<font color=red>localhost:~>grompp -f equi_sol.mdp -p neutral.top -c
neutral_mini.pdb -n neutral.ndx</font>
<p>
<font color=red>localhost:~>mdrun -v -o neutral_sol_equi.pdb
</font>
<p>
The result of the solvent equilibration on the A20T20 oligomer is
available <a href=files/neutral_sol_equi.pdb>here</a>.
